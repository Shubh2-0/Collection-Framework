    POINTS TO BE REMEMBER ABOUT HASHSET	
    
    1.store only unique elements
    2.order of insertion is not maintain
    3.size is DYNAMIC
    4.store the elements in random order
    5.we can not access the elements by index (not index-basing collection)
    6.if we want to access elements of hashSet so first we have to converted into arrayList  
    
    
THERE ARE TOTAL SIX METHOD FOR TRAVERSING IN LINKEDLIST 
1.using a for-each loop
2.using an iterator
3.using the forEach() method    */

here we use wrapper class because 
collection are only store objects
and wrapper class is the representation 
of primitives data type like int , char and so on

when we add primitive data type
in collections they automatically 
converted into their respective Wrapper class
and this process is called AUTO BOXING

and we access or use the element 
that are converted into their 
respective Wrapper class they 
automatically converted into
their original data type that is
primitive data type and this process
is called AUTO UNBOXING */

for traversing through iterator first
